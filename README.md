## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems that software developers face during software development. They provide a template for solving problems in a reusable and maintainable way. This repository aims to provide comprehensive examples and explanations for various design patterns implemented using the Java programming language.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

1. **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point to access it.
2. **Factory Method**: Define an interface for creating an object but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be instantiated.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter**: Allow objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a layer that translates one interface to another.
2. **Decorator**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
3. **Composite**: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
4. **Proxy**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Behavioral Patterns

1. **Observer**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
2. **Strategy**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
3. **Command**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
4. **Iterator**: Provide a way to access elements of a collection object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
